As part of applying my JavaScript skills, I developed an interactive mini web game inspired by the classic dinosaur jumping game. The goal was to create a simple yet engaging user experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this project, I designed a red box (representing the player) and a blue box (representing an obstacle). The red box is placed in a fixed position, while the blue box continuously moves towards it at a set speed. The player must click the red box to make it jump and avoid colliding with the blue obstacle. The logic for detecting the jump, timing, and collision was implemented using JavaScript.

I used event listeners to detect user interaction—specifically, the onclick event on the red box. When triggered, a class was added temporarily to simulate the jump through CSS animation. I also implemented a collision detection function in JavaScript using position comparison through the getComputedStyle() method to constantly check if the red and blue boxes touched. If the user failed to make the red box jump in time and a collision occurred, a popup message would appear saying “You lost,” providing feedback to the player.

This project allowed me to deeply understand how JavaScript works with the DOM and how logic can be applied to create interactive, real-time applications. I also learned how to synchronize CSS animations with JavaScript events, improve game responsiveness, and manage timing intervals for continuous movement. The use of condition checking, event handling, and DOM manipulation helped me enhance my JavaScript proficiency.

Overall, this game not only demonstrated my problem-solving and logical thinking abilities but also strengthened my front-end development skills. It was a fun and practical way to apply JavaScript in creating a functional and user-friendly mini game.
